## üí° Project Ideas

_Ideas to Build with AI Oracle or zkOracle._

### ai/fi Ideas

ai/fi = AI + DeFi.

ai/fi is the fusion of AI (verifiable AI inference provided by Onchain AI Oracle) and DeFi.

The strategy to transform DeFi into ai/fi is simple: "identify the computationally intensive part of any DeFi protocol and replace it with AI."

*: Based on [InsORAnce](https://github.com/ethTaipei2024/insORAnce) idea, LLM can be a judge / verifier of anything. In InsORAnce, LLM judges if insurance should be paid out based on a protocol's hack (truth) and given rules defining a hack (pre-made template / rule). Actually, the truth and pre-made rule can also be: any onchain events (og wallet moves ETH), and even offchain event. So that the InsORAnce idea can be expanded to insurance for anything onchain + offchain.
